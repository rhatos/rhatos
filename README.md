- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rhatos
I am a computer science major at the University of Cape Town. At the moment I'm working on building full-stack applications.

I however am more interested in things like game development and the actual theory of computer science. 

My go-to stack right now is: Sveltekit, Typescript/JS, Firebase.

Otherwise I'm studying mainly Java at university along with some database stuff.

This is my GitHub page and there's not much on it yet :)
